// This class is intended to improve the efficiency of using multiple different
// shaders, etc. without having the developers worry about the order in which things
// will be drawn.  Currently, it is just a wrapper that sets the correct
// shaders, sets camera data, and calls Draw on the object.  In the future, it will queue
// draw calls so that objects using the same set of shaders will all be drawn in one batch, 
// minimizing the number of times we need to switch shaders.
